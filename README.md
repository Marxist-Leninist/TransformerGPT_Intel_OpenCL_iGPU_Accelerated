Below is a **`README.md`** file you can place in your **`my_transformers/`** folder. It provides clear **instructions** on how to install dependencies, run the project, and interpret the outputs. It also includes some **tips** for debugging or improving the partial training setup. Feel free to **copy/paste** this entire text into a file named `README.md` in the `my_transformers/` folder, **no modifications** needed.

# My Transformers (OpenCL GPT) Project

A minimal demonstration of a **Transformer GPT** model that:
- Uses **OpenCL** (via [`pyopencl`](https://pypi.org/project/pyopencl/)) for **forward-pass** ops: matrix multiplication, add-bias, ReLU, and row-wise softmax.
- Performs **partial backprop** on CPU for the **embedding** and **final LM head** parameters only (for simplicity).
- Trains on a **hard-coded** text file:  
  `C:\Users\Scott\Downloads\my_transformers\o1Prochatdata.txt`
- Generates a small text snippet after training.

## Folder Structure

```
my_transformers/
├── __init__.py
├── opencl_backend.py
├── embedding.py
├── multi_head_attention.py
├── feed_forward.py
├── pos_encoding.py
├── dataset.py
├── multi_layer_gpt.py
├── training.py
└── main.py
```

- **`__init__.py`**: Makes `my_transformers/` recognized as a Python package.  
- **`opencl_backend.py`**: OpenCL kernels (matmul, add_bias, relu_inplace, softmax) + Python wrapper.  
- **`embedding.py`**: A simple token embedding class.  
- **`multi_head_attention.py`**: Single multi-head attention block, uses GPU-based rowwise softmax.  
- **`feed_forward.py`**: A 2-layer MLP (expansion factor 4) as used in Transformers.  
- **`pos_encoding.py`**: Sinusoidal positional encoding.  
- **`dataset.py`**: A `HardcodedDataset` that loads from `o1Prochatdata.txt` in the same folder.  
- **`multi_layer_gpt.py`**: A multi-layer GPT model (embedding, optional pos enc, repeated blocks, final LM head).  
- **`training.py`**: Contains `TransformerTrainer` for partial training (only embedding + final LM head).  
- **`main.py`**: The driver script. Loads dataset, builds model, trains for 200 steps, prints loss, and does a generation sample.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8** or higher recommended
- **PyOpenCL** (for OpenCL GPU ops). Install via:
  ```bash
  pip install pyopencl
  ```
- **NumPy** (for array operations)
  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```
- **BeautifulSoup** or other packages are **not** strictly required for this minimal example, only if you do extra scraping.  

If you see a warning like:
```
RecommendedHashNotFoundWarning: ...
```
you can optionally install `siphash24`:
```bash
python -m pip install siphash24
```
to get rid of that warning.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure** your folder looks like this:
   ```
   C:\Users\Scott\Downloads\
   └── my_transformers\
       ├── __init__.py
       ├── opencl_backend.py
       ├── embedding.py
       ├── multi_head_attention.py
       ├── feed_forward.py
       ├── pos_encoding.py
       ├── dataset.py
       ├── multi_layer_gpt.py
       ├── training.py
       └── main.py
   ```
   And **your text file** is at:
   ```
   C:\Users\Scott\Downloads\my_transformers\o1Prochatdata.txt
   ```

2. **Open a terminal** in `C:\Users\Scott\Downloads\`.  
3. **Run**:
   ```bash
   python -m my_transformers.main
   ```
   This tells Python to treat `my_transformers` as a package and run `main.py` as the entry point.

4. You should see console output like:
   ```
   [HardcodedDataset] Loaded text from: ...
   [TokenEmbedding] Created embedding of shape ...
   [Info] Using GPU device: Intel(R) Iris(R) Xe Graphics
   ...
   Step 0/200, loss=8.45
   Step 20/200, loss=8.42
   ...
   === Generating text sample ===
   Generated text:
    some snippet of repeated characters ...
   ```

## Explanation of the Outputs

- **Loss**:  
  Every 20 steps, it prints the cross-entropy on the last batch. Since we’re only partially training embedding + final head, you might see the loss vary but (hopefully) trend downward.

- **Generated Text**:  
  After the training loop finishes, it does a simple token-by-token generation. Since it’s only partially trained, the text may look repetitive or nonsensical. With enough data and partial updates, it may start to produce more coherent text.

## Common Issues / Tips

1. **`SyntaxError: invalid syntax`** in `opencl_backend.py`  
   - Remove or comment out any `// end KERNEL_CODE` inside triple quotes.  
   - Example fix:
     ```python
     KERNEL_CODE = r"""
     #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_fp32 : enable
     ...
     """
     # end KERNEL_CODE
     ```

2. **`ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`**  
   - Always run with `python -m my_transformers.main` (from the parent directory).  
   - Or remove relative imports in each file (turn `.dataset` into just `dataset`) if you want to run `python main.py` directly. But that’s less recommended.

3. **`C:\Users\Scott\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\site-packages\pyopencl\cache.py:420: CompilerWarning: Non-empty compiler output encountered.`**  
   - This is just a **warning**. If everything else runs, you can ignore it. If you want to see the compiler output, set:
     ```bash
     set PYOPENCL_COMPILER_OUTPUT=1
     ```
   - Then rerun, you’ll see more verbose logs.

4. **Large Memory Usage**  
   - If your text file is large (like ~10 MB or more) and your GPU has limited shared memory, keep batch_size small (4 or 8) and hidden_dim moderate (like 32).  

5. **Partial vs. Full Training**  
   - The code **only** updates the embedding + final LM head. MHA + FF param remain constant. If you want full backprop, you must store intermediate states (Q, K, V, etc.) and add code to do derivatives. This is *significantly* more involved.

## Extending This Project

- **Multi-Layer**: Increase `n_layers`.  
- **Larger hidden_dim**: If you have more GPU memory, try `hidden_dim=64` or `128`.  
- **More Steps**: Increase from 200 steps to, say, 2000 or 20,000 steps.  
- **Better Generation**: Implement top-k or top-p sampling instead of `argmax` in `generate_text()`.

**Enjoy** exploring a minimal OpenCL-based Transformer GPT approach. If you have questions or want to do full backprop, you can expand the code in `training.py` for MHA/FF param updates.
